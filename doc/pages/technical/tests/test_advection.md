### Advection test program

The test program is implemented in [[test_advection.F90]] and in addition to the advection from the [[getm_operators]] implemented as a submodule in [[advection.F90]] (and related files with specific advection scheme algorithms - e.g. [[advection_upstream.F90]] via preprocessing [[advection.F90.template]]) also the [[getm_domain]] and [[getm_output]] modules are used.
