In the case where a coordinate variable cannot be fitted with any kind of relevant dimensional data, or if the model does not want to give such information, it is possible to assign a default value to the standard_name attribute, which is specific to the COMODO file format:

[xyz]_grid_index with x, y, z according the value of the axis attribute ;
[xyz]_grid_index_at_[uvfw]_location to specify the position of variable on the grid (see Grid placement).
In this case, the value of the coordinate variable elements should correspond to the coordinate of the data along the given axis, with the convention that the first tracer (cell-centered) point is located at (1,1).
